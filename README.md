ðŸ§¾ Narrative (For CTO/Exec Audience):

The bubble chart shows a clear, positive relationship between average client usage and productive wage costs across business units. Each unit scales in a consistent pattern â€” as client usage increases, wage costs rise accordingly. This is supported by a strong correlation coefficient (r = 0.83).

Notably, there are no outliers:

    No business unit is driving high usage with unusually low wage cost (which might suggest efficiency),

    Nor is any unit incurring high wage costs despite low usage (which would point to inefficiency).

This trend confirms that wage spend is tightly linked to demand or activity levels. The largest units (e.g., dark blue) are not only more active but also carry the highest wage burden. Conversely, units like the purple bubble operate at minimal usage and cost, likely playing a limited or niche role.
ðŸ§© Business Recommendations:

    Optimize High-Usage Units:
    Focus cost-efficiency efforts on large BUs where wage spend is high. These units represent the biggest opportunity for productivity gains or automation.

    Evaluate Low-Impact Units:
    Review the role and ROI of low-usage, low-cost units (e.g., purple). Consider whether to grow, repurpose, or streamline them based on strategic priorities.

    Monitor Scaling Efficiency:
    Since usage drives cost linearly, investigate whether higher-usage units are scaling productivity at the same rate â€” or just cost. Look into output per wage hour or unit economics.

    Benchmark Wages per Usage Unit:
    Create a metric to track wage efficiency across BUs (e.g., wage cost per usage unit). This would help identify subtle inefficiencies even among units that appear proportional
